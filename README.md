# Customer Care Data Processing

This project automates the processing and analysis of customer care data, specifically designed to enhance customer support operations by tracking key performance metrics such as inquiry types, resolution times, and customer satisfaction. This Python-based solution aligns with real-world customer care roles, where managing and analyzing customer interactions efficiently is critical for maintaining high service standards.

## Features
- **Automated Data Processing**: Automatically parses and processes customer inquiries, including account-related issues, payment problems, and fund transfers.
- **Resolution Time Tracking**: Logs and analyzes the time taken to resolve each customer query to ensure adherence to service-level agreements (SLAs).
- **Customer Satisfaction Analysis**: Tracks customer satisfaction scores to help identify areas for improvement in customer service.
- **Scalable Design**: Can handle large volumes of customer service data for batch processing and reporting.

## How to Run the Project
Follow these steps to run the project on your local machine:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abansria/Customer-Care-Data-Processing.git
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory
Move into the project directory:

```bash
cd Customer-Care-Data-Processing
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
If there are any dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file, you can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Run the Python Script
Execute the main Python script to process the customer care data:

```bash
python src/process_customer_data.py
```

The processed output will be saved in the `data/processed_data_output.txt` file.

## Sample Data
- **Raw Data**: The `customer_care_raw_data.txt` file contains 500 sample customer service inquiries with attributes such as inquiry type, resolution time, and customer satisfaction score.
- **Processed Data**: The `processed_data_output.txt` file contains the results of the data processing, showing how each inquiry was handled.

## Use Cases
This project can be adapted for real-world scenarios like:
- **Customer Care Centers**: Automating inquiry tracking and performance measurement.
- **Banking Support**: Handling customer onboarding, account maintenance, and issue resolution.
- **Service-Level Agreement (SLA) Management**: Ensuring timely resolution of customer queries and adherence to internal SLAs.
- **Customer Satisfaction Reporting**: Providing insights into how well customer service teams are performing, based on satisfaction scores.
